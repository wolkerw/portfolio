          <p>
            I shudder to recall that dreadful Diwali night of October 2007, when
            my mother knocked our bed room at the dead of the night enquiring
            where the toilet was. She looked disoriented and totally confused.
            Unable to understand the cause for her abnormal behaviour, we
            thought she was still in a semi-sleep state and showed her the
            toilet. But even after coming out of toilet she was unable to find
            her way to her bed room.
          </p>

      <div className={styles.section}>
        <p className={styles.fixed}>
          Sensing that something is seriously amiss, we took her next day to the
          nearby nursing home for diagnosis and treatment. She was immediately
          referred to a neurosurgeon and after a MRI scan it was confirmed that
          she suffered a brain stroke. The report showed certain grey patches
          which the doctor referred to as clots have affected her memory
          totally. The doctor informed that the memory loss is irreversible due
          to her old age. He, however, assured that further, damage to the brain
          can be arrested with drugs.

          That was the beginning of the slow end for my mother. As the disease
          got worsened, she forgot everything. Lost control of her body
          functions and finally, failed to recognize anyone except my wife who
          used to take care of her like a mother taking care of her baby. She
          used to feed her, change her diapers, dress her, give her bath, brush
          her hair, and also help her to sleep.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div className={styles.section}>

          For my wife and me, she was like a little child. Our world revolved
          around her. We used to play with her, tease her. We even celebrated
          her 80th birth day with a grand cake cutting ceremony attended by my
          wife’s friends in Kolkata. It was a moment of happiness for her as she
          kept smiling at every one greeting her on her birth day without
          knowing whose birth day it was. So when one of the guests greeted her
          with a “wish you a happy birth day”, she promptly responded by wishing
          her the same!

          It was interesting to know that even after destroying her brain cells;
          the disease could not take away the basic courtesies from her,
          acquired during her training as a Telephone Operator long long ago.
          They remained entrenched in her till her last breath. She never forgot
          to express her sincere thanks whenever we help her with little things.

          The thud sound of a body hitting the ground rudely awakened us. We
          looked around to find my mother missing from her bed. In a swift
          motion my wife jumped from the bed and dashed out of the room to find
          her lay flat, face down on the floor motion less. Her fore head was
          badly injured. She was bleeding profusely from her lips due to the
          impact of the fall. But there was virtually no reaction from her. We
          physically lifted her and put her on the bed. My wife gently cleansed
          the wound and enquired whether it was hurting. She replied in
          affirmative. But there was no sign of pain in the face. No tears in
          her eyes. Just plain disoriented look, devoid of any feelings and
          emotions. The disease took away all her emotional feelings and also
          dried up the tear glands. Looking at her state I cried silently.
        </p>

      <div className={styles.section}>
        <p className={styles.fixed}>
          Oh God! I said to myself. Is this is my mother, who used to get tears
          in her eyes even for a faint discomfort? She was emotionally so
          sensitive that even a stern look, would bring her to tears. Such was
          her reputation for crying that my father used to tease her by calling
          her “Gangadhari”. Lady wearing river Ganges on her head.

          The day she passed away and as her body was being carried in a
          “Hearse” van there were unexpected showers for few minutes as if the
          heavens have cried for her, as she forgot to cry.
